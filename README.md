# Bike-Rental-Prediction
## Overview

The aim is to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a Random Forest Algorithm.

Tasks:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Attributes distribution and trends
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test dataset
4. Creatimg a model using the random forest algorithm
5. Predicting the performance of the model on the test dataset
