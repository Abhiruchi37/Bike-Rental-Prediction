# Bike-Rental-Prediction
## Overview

The aim is to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a Random Forest Algorithm.

Tasks:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Attributes distribution and trends
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test dataset
4. Creating a model using the random forest algorithm
5. Predicting the performance of the model on the test dataset

## Setup
1. Prerequisites:
   - **R version**:  version 4.3.2 or above
   - **Packages**: Install using 'install.packages("name")' and load using 'library(name)'.\
     -GGally: Explores relationships between variables and visualizing overall trends in dataset.\
     -caret: Comprehensive toolkit for machine learning in R, providing functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\
     -purrr: Functional programming library in R, promoting concise and efficient ways to work with data structures and functions.\
     -randomForest: Implementation of the random forest algorithm.\
     -missForest: Imputes missing data using random forests.\
     -ranger: Another random forest implementation known for its speed and scalability for large datasets.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Abhiruchi37/Bike-Rental_Prediction.git]
3. Navigate to directory:
   cd Bike-Rental-Prediction
4. Run main script:
   source("BikeRentalPred.R")
